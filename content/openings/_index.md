## Internships

If you want to do an internship with me, please contact me with your interests, your preferred timeline for the internship, and your level of funding. Doing an internship with me is practically “free”, aside from the cost of living in Clemson. If you come from outside the U.S., the immigration services will require that you have sufficient funds to support yourself, though. If you require a U.S. Visa, please contact me early, so that this can be arranged on time!

If you already have funding, then I am happy to advise you on a project of your own choosing, as long as it broadly aligns with my interests.
