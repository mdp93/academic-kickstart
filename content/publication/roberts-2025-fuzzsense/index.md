abstract: Fuzz testing to find semantic control vulnerabilities is an essential activity to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving (AD) software. Whilst there is a preponderance of disparate fuzzing tools that target different parts of the test environment, such as the scenario, sensors, and vehicle dynamics, there is a lack of fuzzing strategies that ensemble these fuzzers to enable concurrent fuzzing, utilizing diverse techniques and targets. This research proposes FuzzSense, a modular, black-box, mutation-based fuzzing framework that is architected to ensemble diverse AD fuzzing tools. To validate the utility of FuzzSense, a LiDAR sensor fuzzer was developed as a plug-in, and the fuzzer was implemented in the new AD simulation platform AWSIM and this http URL AD software platform. The results demonstrated that FuzzSense was able to find vulnerabilities in the new this http URL software. We contribute to FuzzSense open-source with the aim of initiating a conversation in the community on the design of AD-specific fuzzers and the establishment of a community fuzzing framework to better target the diverse technology base of autonomous vehicles.
