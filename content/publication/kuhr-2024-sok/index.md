abstract: Cameras are crucial sensors for autonomous vehicles. They capture images that are essential for many safety-critical tasks, including perception. To process these images, a complex pipeline with multiple layers is used. Security attacks on this pipeline can severely affect passenger safety and system performance. However, many attacks overlook different layers of the pipeline, and their feasibility and impact vary. While there has been research to improve the quality and robustness of the image processing pipeline, these efforts often work in parallel with security research, without much awareness of their potential synergy. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by combining security and robustness research for the image processing pipeline in autonomous vehicles. We classify the risk of attacks using the automotive security standard ISO 21434, emphasizing the need to consider all layers for overall system security. We also demonstrate how existing robustness research can help mitigate the impact of attacks, addressing the current research gap. Finally, we present an embedded testbed that can influence various parameters across all layers, allowing researchers to analyze the effects of different defense strategies and attack impacts. We demonstrate the importance of such a test environment through a use-case analysis and show how blinding attacks can be mitigated using HDR imaging as an example of robustness-related research.
